## Purpose
The purpose of Bostwick testing is to quantitatively measure the set (consistency) of starch based spoon-able products.

## Terms/Definitions

**Bostwick (or Bostwick Consistometer):** The Bostwick is the physical device or tool used to measure the consistency, viscosity or flow of a sample by measuring the distance the material flows under its own weight in a designated period of time (commonly 30 seconds).

**cm/30s:** Or centimeters per 30 seconds is the unit used to quantify the consistency of the sample.

## Procedure

### Prep
Samples should only be tested if they have been allowed to set for a **minimum of 2 days**. Samples should be between 36&deg;F and 40&deg;F.
#### **DO NOT SHAKE OR STIR THE PRODUCT**
> Much of the structure of our product is based on a matrix formed by activated starch molecules. The molecules pull water inside forming a balloon and then stick to one another creating a semi-organized and semi-rigid &quot;brick-wall&quot; arrangement which lends to the set and consistency of the product. At lower temperatures (below ~60&deg;F), if this structure is disrupted or *sheared* the &quot;balloons&quot; pop and release that water destroying the &quot;brick-wall&quot; and consistency of the product. Stirring or shaking the product will significantly increase our Bostwick reading and will inaccurately represent the quality of our product.

The Bostwick device must be clean, dry and no warmer than room temperature (if hot water is used during cleaning, rinse with cool water to return the metal to room temperature or cooler).

### Step 1
Place the Bostwick device on the counter and adjust the leveling screws until the level indicator is centered in the level.

### Step 2
Close and lock the release gate. Closely examine the contact points around the gate and ensure that no trapped water has seeped into the testing contact areas.

### Step 3
Open the sample and gently spoon the product into the sample holding chamber. Try to scoop a large amount of product into the chamber at once to prevent cutting the structure at several points.

The chamber should be completely filled and level with the top of the chamber. Use a knife or scraper to scrape excess product off the top. Excess product above the level of the chamber walls will add weight to the sample and skew the results unfavorably.

### Step 4
Ready a stopwatch or a 30 second timer. Simultaneously start the clock and release the gate. Allow the product to flow down the length of the device for 30 seconds.

### Step 5
Observe the position of the product on the device exactly at the 30 second mark. Record this value as cm/30s on the appropriate form.
